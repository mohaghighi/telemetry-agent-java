# Notes:
# * duplicate routes pointing to a "collection" adding an extra rule with a trailing slash
#   so that collections can be retrieved with and without the trailing "/"
# * prefix every action with `@` to avoid caching exceptions occurring in controllers constructors
#   (see https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/JavaDependencyInjection for more info)
